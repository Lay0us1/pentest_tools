*"What is this??"*

When I first started learning pentesting, I used to struggle with hydra syntax when it came to bruteforcing web page logins. I spent a long time looking at various websites for the right syntax, and then shouting at the terminal when it didn't work. So I have written a tool to generate the syntax for you, based on some simple parameters you can specify.

*"How do I use it??"*

Simple! "python hydragen.py" - the tool will walk you through specifying the parameters it needs, such as the url, the username and password lists you want to use, etc, and then it will churn out the fully complete hydra syntax for you to run.

*"Why is this only for http-post-forms? Hydra does so much more!!"*

Yeah, and the syntax for the majority of its functions is basic. This is the one I always struggled to remember, so this is the one you get a tool for.
