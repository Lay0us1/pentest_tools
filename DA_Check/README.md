A Python script for checking a list of credentials for Domain Administrator privileges against a Domain Controller. Will also find the Domain Controllers IP address on your current network if you do not know it.

Requires crackmapexec and nmap to be installed on system (made for kali really...)

Credentials must be in text file in the following format:
>User1:Pass1
>
>User2:Pass2
>
>User3:Pass3
>
>etc, etc

How to I use this?
>sudo python DA_check.py -c credentials.txt
>
>Follow the prompts

This isnt working...
>Tough, its open source, fix it and let me know.

Is this illegal?
>Use if within scope and you're fine, use it outside of scope and that's your problem not mine!
