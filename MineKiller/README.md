Python DoS attack for killing minecraft servers

This script will flood the minecraft port (19132) on your server of choice with randomly sized UDP packets, slowing down the network, and with enough traffic, bringing it to a halt.

DISCLAIMER:

THIS IS FOR EDICATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! DO NOT USE AGAINST ANY SERVERS YOU DO NOT OWN OR HAVE FULL SIGNED PERMISSION TO TEST ON. USING THIS SCRIPT WITHOUT THE SERVER OWNERS PERMISSION IS HIGHLY ILLEGAL AND YOU WILL FACE PROSECUTION AND LIKELY BE JAILED. You have been warned. Don't be a dick, this is just here to help you to learn to write your own tools.
