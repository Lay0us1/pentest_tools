RecSter (RECursive gobuSTER)

A python script to run gobuster recursively on any directories it finds.

Usage:
  python RecSter.py -u <TARGET URL> -w <WORDLIST> -o <OUTPUT FILENAME>

Please note that due to the nature of a recursive search, this tool can take a LONG time to complete a scan, to that end, be sure to limit your targets to only the directories you need and be mindful of the size of your wordlists!

Props to the original Gobuster from OJ
