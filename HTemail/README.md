How do I use this?

Is there any further help?

    python htemail.py -h

What is this for?

I designed this for OSINT investigations, gathering target emails for phishing campaigns, but feel free to use this for whatever you see fit.

I can't get this to work?

    You many not have the required python packages installed, please install the following and then try again:

    pip install argparse
    pip install requests
