Checks if a list of email addresses are valid Microsoft 365 users.

"How do I use this?"

    python 365validator.py -l input_list.txt -o output.txt

"Is there any further help?"

    python validator.py -h

"What is this for?"

I designed this for OSINT investigations, validating target email addresses for phishing campaigns, but feel free to use this for whatever you see fit.

"I can't get this to work?"

    You're using it wrong, refer to 'How do I use this?'
    It's broken, please let me know.

"Will this show me which accounts are active?"

No, im not a wizard. It will show you which email addresses are valid usernames for logging onto Microsoft 365.

"How does this script work?"

It takes the list of email addresses provided, and for each one makes a post request to microsoft 365 logon. By analysing the responses, it searches for confirmation that the email address is valid and then lets you know which ones are good.

"Is this illegal?"

No absolutely not. But please don't use it for any nefarious activities. Then you might be overstepping the boundries of the law, not me.

    Insert standard "I dont accept responsibility for your stupid actions" disclaimer here...

"The script isn't getting ALL the valid email addresses from the list"

It's possible I have not accounted for all possible confirmation strings. If you know what youre doing with a computer then make a burp request for said email address, find the "IfExistsResult:(n)" for the request, and send the burp request file, the required "IfExistsResult:(n)" string, and email address it missed to me in a pull request. I'll implement valid submissions.
